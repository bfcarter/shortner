Your IDE must support the latest ESLint plugin. Atom (https://atom.io) is the recommended IDE. Install Atomâ€™s linter-eslint package ( https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint ) and you will be able to lint each file. For sublime or any other IDE you will need to research and implement the corresponding eslint plugin.
Make sure you installed the app, before editing it, otherwise eslint won't work.
